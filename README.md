wagtail-blogging
================

[Wagtail](https://www.wagtail.io/) is a convenient way to build CMS-based sites on Django, but it lacks built-in support for WordPress-like blogging. This library aims to address that.

- A new type of page is added to the admin: blog posts.
- The `import_wordpress_posts` command will import exported WordPress content into a Wagtail site.
